visualize and analyze data using python in Jupyter notebook using historical (since 2010) to most recent Bitcoin trading data from Yahoo Finance
# Bitcoin trading prices and volume time series
## Plotting
Plotting is not just for pretty colors and shapes.  
It is impossible to read thousands of rows of prices and trading volumes and quickly get an idea how Bitcoin has been traded.  That is why visualization is necessary.  
1. Different styling
2. Line plots
3. Bar plots
4. Area plots

## Basic data cleaning
No matter where the data comes from, we should do some basic checking for anomalies and errors.  If there is anything usual, we should try to find out why, which may uncover interesting stories that others may have missed.  Besides, we can trust our analysis only if we can reasonably assume the data is mostly error free. 
1. Remove duplicates
2. Check if there is any missing data
3. Error checking

## Time series data essential data mining tools
1. Rolling (moving) window 
2. Resampling
3. Select data with different frequencies
